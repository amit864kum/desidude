                <p class="paragraph">It's been <strong>six years since UPI (Unified Payments Interface) was introduced
                        as a payment system
                        in India.</strong></p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="paragraph">During this period, not only has it become a revolution in the financial lives of
                    Indians, but in
                    fact, it is being adopted by other countries as well. Especially this year, India’s finance
                    ministry, RBI and NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) have inked deals with multiple
                    countries to promote UPI adoption abroad.

                <p class="paragraph"> In July 2021, <strong>Bhutan became the first country to adopt UPI
                    </strong>standards for its QR
                    deployment, and the first country in our immediate neighbourhood to accept mobile-based payments
                    through
                    the BHIM App. In its press release, NPCI mentioned that NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the
                    International arm of the National Payment Corporation of India and the Royal Monetary Authority
                    (RMA) of

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Earlier this year in March, Nepal too deployed India’s UPI payment system. A month before that, NPCI
                    International Payments Limited (NIPL), the international arm of NPCI, had mentioned in a press
                    release that it joined hands with Gateway Payments Service Pvt Ltd, authorized Payment System
                    Operators in Nepal, and Manam Infotech Private Limited to deploy UPI in Nepal for the larger Digital
                    Public Good and to bolster interoperable real-time Person to person (P2P) and Merchant payment
                    transactions (P2M) in Nepal.
                    <br><br>
                    It mentioned that this collaboration will enable the last-mile consumers in Nepal to reap the
                    benefits of an open interoperable payments system driving immediate payment transfers between bank
                    accounts and merchant payments in real time. It will also enable the way forward for real-time
                    cross-border P2P remittances between Nepal and India

                <img src="images/oman.jpg" class="oman">
                <p class="paragraph">In October 2022, Oman formally joined many other nations in adopting UPI for
                    digital transactions across platforms. This comes after New Delhi and Muscat reached a consensus to
                    expand the Indian digital payment ecosystem to the gulf region. A formal agreement in this regard
                    was signed between the NPCI and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) last week.</p><br><br>


                <h2>UAE</h2>
                <img src="images/uae.jpg" class="uae">
                <p class="paragraph">In April 2022, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the International arm of the
                    National Payment Corporation of India, announced that BHIM UPI has been made live at NEOPAY
                    terminals, across the UAE. This initiative will empower millions of Indians who travel to the UAE,
                    to safely and conveniently make payments using BHIM UPI. NIPL and NEOPAY, the payment subsidiary of
                    Mashreq bank, partnered last year to create the acceptance infrastructure in the UAE. </p><br><br>

                    payments solution provider Lyra Network, Union Communications and Electronics and Information
                    Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced it during his France visit for the Viva Technology
                    2022 event. <br>
                    <br>
                    "The whole world is watching that India is doing 5.5 billion UPI transactions in a month. This is a
                    big achievement for India. Today’s MoU with France is a big step towards the world," Vaishnaw told
                    ANI. <br><br>
                    India's Ambassador to Singapore, Jawed Ashraf told ANI that "we will have to discuss this with the
                    central bank, regulator, as well as companies here in France. In France, there is very less use of
                    digital payment. But it needs to be integrated and seamless. It lacks efficiency as we have in
                    India." <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, one of Europe's biggest start-up conferences Viva Technology 2022 recognised India as
                    "country of the year" in light of the start up boom and technological advances that have taken place
                    in India after the Covid-19 pandemic. <br><br>

                    starting with QR code-based transactions. <br><br>
                    The NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL) has already forged a partnership with payments solutions

                <h2>NPCI’s Recent Partnership</h2><br><br>
                <p class="paragraph">Last month, Worldline, a global leader in payments services, joined forces with
                    NPCI International Payments Ltd. (NIPL), the international arm of the National Payments Corporation
                    of India (NPCI) to expand the acceptance of Indian payment means across Europe.
                    <br><br>
                    As part of the partnership inked in October 2022, Worldline will bring more convenience for Indian
                    customers in the European markets by allowing merchants’ point-of-sale (POS) systems to accept
                    payments from UPI, an instant real-time payment system, as well as RuPay, NPCI’s proprietary card
                    payment network solution. This will result in a multitude of customer-related merchant benefits due
                    to an increase in footfall and spending from Indian tourists, as per the press release.
                    <br><br>
                    Facilitated via Worldline QR, the company’s universal product for the acceptance of all QR-based
                    payments, the first target markets for NIPL are set to include BENELUX and Switzerland with further
                    plans for expansion, as Worldline QR is rolled out in more European countries. <br><br>It also
                    mentioned that India is one of the most important tourist markets for Europe with an estimated 10
                    million Indians travelling to the region each year prior to the pandemic, according to Schengen
                    Visa. Now, as the impacts of COVID-19 begin to subside, that number is expected to significantly
                    increase.
